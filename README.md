# OEREB-DB-STRUCTURE

This is a simple mirror of the [repo from canton Solothurn](https://github.com/oereb/oereb-db). The advantage of this repo is the build
of the structure already contained in the image. This prevents long boot times and makes the DB adressable via standard docker tool.

In addition this repo contains the ili2db tools (ili2pg) to offer easy use for importing all data directly in the database as subsequent
docker layers.
